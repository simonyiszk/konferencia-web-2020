## ðŸš€ Getting started

- Recommended editor is Visual Studio Code
- Install Node 12 and Yarn v1
- Install Gatsby CLI `yarn global add gatsby-cli`
- Clone the repo with git or Github Desktop
- Add all recommended addons to VSCode
- Install dependencies with `yarn install`
  - Restart VSCode if it still doesn't recognize the installed node modules
- Start a development server with `yarn develop` (`gatsby develop`)
  - _Other scripts like `build`, [`format`](#automatic-code-formatting), [`type-check`](#static-type-checking) and [`lint`](#linting) are also available_

## âœ¨ Developer experience

- After someone introduces a new dependency you need to run `yarn` after pull, to add said dependency.
- If you want to add a new dependency, it needs to have types: https://microsoft.github.io/TypeSearch/
  - Alternatively you can add a new line to the `decalrations.d.ts` file: `declare module "name-of-package"`

### Automatic code formatting

[Prettier][] aims to provide codebase consistency when multiple developers work on the same project. The main reason behind adopting it is to [stop all the on-going debates over coding styles][].

### Static type checking

[TypeScript][] adds optional types to JavaScript, preventing several programming mistakes. For a quick guide about using React with it, please refer to the [React TypeScript Cheatsheet][].

### Linting

Source code is linted by [ESLint][], enforcing the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide][] through an overridable set of rules provided by [eslint-config-airbnb][].
